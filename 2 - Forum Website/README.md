My forum website is a web-based application that allows registered users to share and discuss stories. The website's primary feature is the ability for users to post stories consisting of a title, a link, and a body. Once posted, other users can view and comment on the story.

Any visitor or user can view stories and comments. On the homepage, a user can click on a story's title to see the forum post or click on the story's shortened link to see the associated webpage. Any visitor or user can also click on a user's name by their comment or post to view their profile, which consists of the user's name, a brief biography, and all of their posts, sorted in chronological order. Upon signing up, a user gain the ability to post, edit, and delete their own posts and comments.

The front-end of the website is built using PHP, HTML, and CSS. The back-end is also developed using PHP and integrates with MySQL to store all user account information, stories, comments, and other relevant data.
