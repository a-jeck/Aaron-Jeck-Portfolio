My JavaScript calendar is a web-based application that allows users to create, view, and manage their events online. The user can log in to their account and see their existing events displayed in a calendar format. The calendar shows the current month with dates highlighted for events. Users can navigate to different months and years using the built-in navigation.

The application allows users to add new events to the calendar by clicking on a specific date. The user can then enter the event details, including the title, time, and color of the event. They can also modify or delete existing events by clicking on the event within the calendar. A fun addition is that when an event has "birthday" in the title, confetti appears on the screen when the user clicks on it.

The application is built using a combination of technologies, including JavaScript, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. JavaScript is used to create the dynamic and interactive user interface, while CSS is used to style the page. The server-side scripting language, PHP, is used to handle user authentication and manage data storage in MySQL. MySQL is used to store user account information, event details, and other relevant data.

The calendar is hosted on an Apache-based web server on AWS, running Amazon Linux 2. I interface with the server and the data via terminal and phpMyAdmin.
